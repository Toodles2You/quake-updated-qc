# Quake updated QuakeC source code

This repository contains updated QuakeC source code for Quake and its two 
Mission Packs! The code is based on the last official source code releases 
prior to the 2021 rerelease. Many known issues and gameplay quirks have been 
fixed.  

The goal of this repository is to provide:  
- The best possible vanilla Quake experience for players  
- A clean, stable and portable starting point for developers  

The Mission Packs have been rebased on top of the main branch. Check out the 
`hipnotic` branch for Scourge of Armagon, and the `rogue` branch for 
Dissolution of Eternity!  

This code is released under the GPLv2 license. See `COPYING` for more details.
